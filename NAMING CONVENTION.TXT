GROUND TRUTH NAMING CONVENTION:
    Ensure to name any of the ground trust data following the structure below
        "Train_data_##.csv"

    Also ensure that the MOCAP data is saved as a .csv file

IMU NAMING CONVENTION:
    The IMU data pipeline generates a folder from the software. Ensure to name the resulting folder as follows
        "Train_Data_##_IMU"

    The folder will contain n (the number of IMU's) .csv, .wplay, and 1 Matlab folder. Double check to ensure
    you have three separate csv files each IMU - the IMU pipeline default is to combine all the active IMU's into
    one csv file
